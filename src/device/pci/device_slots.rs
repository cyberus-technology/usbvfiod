/// Abstraction for Device Slots.
///
/// Each USB device needs a device slot ID to be addressable.

///
/// - index of the device context base address array (DCBAA), which points to
///   the associated device context.
/// - index of the doorbell register.
/// - referenced in event and command TRBs
///
/// The XHCI controller reports the maximum number of device slots in the
/// HCSPARAMS1 register. For device initialization, the driver requests a slot
/// ID using the Enable Slot Command. The `DeviceSlotManager` is responsible
/// of tracking which slot IDs are currently in use.
