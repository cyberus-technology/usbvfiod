# usbvfiod

**usbvfiod** is a Rust-based tool designed to enable USB device
passthrough to [Cloud
Hypervisor](https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor)
virtual machines using the [vfio-user
protocol](https://github.com/tmakatos/qemu/blob/master/docs/devel/vfio-user.rst). Other
VMMs might also work, but but are currently not the main target.
