# usbvfiod

**usbvfiod** is a Rust-based tool designed to enable USB device
passthrough to [Cloud
Hypervisor](https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor)
virtual machines using the [vfio-user
protocol](https://github.com/tmakatos/qemu/blob/master/docs/devel/vfio-user.rst). Other
VMMs might also work, but but are currently not the main target.

This project is still under active development and **not usable
yet**. We are planning to work on this project in the following order:

1. **Validating our Assumptions** (Done)
   - We are looking for suitable libraries to use and finalize our design.
2. **Towards USB Storage Passthrough** (ðŸš§ **Ongoing** ðŸš§)
   - We build up a virtual XHCI controller and the necessary plumbing
     to pass-through USB devices from the host.
   - Our initial test target will be USB storage devices.
3. **Broaden Device Support**
   - We broaden the set of USB devices we support and actively test.

If you want to use this code, please check back later or [get in

## Development

The following section is meant for developers.

### Testing with Cloud Hypervisor

An easy way to get a testing setup is to connect `usbvfiod` with Cloud
Hypervisor. For this, start `usbvfiod` in one terminal:

```console
$ cargo run -- --socket-path /tmp/usbvfiod.sock -vv
2025-04-25T09:41:40.891734Z  INFO usbvfiod: We're up!
```

In another terminal, start Cloud Hypervisor. Any recent version will
do:

```console
$ cloud-hypervisor \
   --memory size=4G,shared=on \
   --serial tty \
   --user-device socket=/tmp/usbvfiod.sock \
   --console off \
   --kernel KERNEL \
   --initramfs INITRD \
   --cmdline KERNEL_CMDLINE
```

`KERNEL`, `INITRD`, and `KERNEL_CMDLINE` are placeholders for a Linux
kernel image (`bzImage`), a initrd or initramfs and the corresponding
command line.

> [!TIP]
> To get a kernel and initramfs to play with, you can use the [NixOS](https://nixos.org/)
> [netboot](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-booting-from-pxe) binaries.
>
> You will find a kernel (`bzImage`) and initrd. The required command
> line for booting is in `result/netboot.ipxe`. You want to add
> `console=ttyS0` to get console output.
>
> ```console
> $ nix-build -A netboot.x86_64-linux '<nixpkgs/nixos/release.nix>'
> $ ls result/
> bzImage initrd netboot.ipxe
> ...
> $ grep -o "init=[^$]*" result/netboot.ipxe
> init=/nix/store/.../init initrd=initrd nohibernate loglevel=4
> ```

### Attaching USB Devices

For the time being, USB devices can only be attached when `usbvfiod`
is started. `usbvfiod` takes the path to the USB device node. These
paths are of the form `/dev/bus/usb/$BUS/$DEVICE`.

To figure out the bus and device numbers of a specific USB device, use
the `lsusb` utility (typically installed via the `usbutils` package):

```console
$ lsusb
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 8087:0033 Intel Corp. AX211 Bluetooth
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
Bus 002 Device 003: ID 18a5:0243 Verbatim, Ltd Flash Drive (Store'n'Go)
```

So for attaching the flash drive you would add `--device
/dev/bus/usb/002/003` as a parameter to `usbvfiod`. `usbvfiod` must
have permission to read and write the device node.

> [!NOTE]
> Attached USB devices do not yet appear in the guest. The relevant plumbing
> is not implemented yet.

### Format Checks

`.toml` files in the repository are formatted using
[taplo](https://taplo.tamasfe.dev/). To re-format `.toml` files, you
can use:

```console
$ taplo format file.toml
```

### Temporarily Ignoring Pre-Commit Checks

When committing incomplete or work-in-progress changes, the pre-commit
checks can become annoying. In this case, use:

```console
$ git commit --no-verify
```
